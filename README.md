When submitting your assignment, include answers to the following.

## Identify the component of this assignment that you did the best on, and why.
I am not sure. I am still learning. I feel like every part of this assignment was a learning process and a struggle. 

## Describe in plain english what problem this assignment was posing, and what your solution was to it.
The problem this assignment posed was to add two input number fields and show results. 

## What was your approach or process?
My approach was to create the html and css files first. I got the design out of the way, and then I focused on the javascript and creating a switch statement to make the calculator function. I also wanted to add some validations to make the calculator much more efficient.

## What were your challenges?
My biggest problems were creating the switch statement and converting strings into numbers. I also had to learn different functions and how to use them, such as number, switch and methods: getElementById and attribute value. I also somehow forgot to link my javascript to html. I don't know how I forgot about that. 

## What resources did you use?
I used the powerpoint slides from this week, w3schools and a TA's help.
